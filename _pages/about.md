I am currently a lecturer in Beijing Information Science & Technology University and an adjunct researcher at Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI). Before that, I worked at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) as a researcher in media computing group. I was an research intern at visual computing (VC) group of MSRA supervised by Dr. Bo Xin and Prof. Gang Hua. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in computer science from Peking University at 2019 under the supervision of Prof. Yizhou Wang, and bachelor's degree in computer science from Harbin Institute of Technology at 2013. During 2014-2015, I have been visiting vision group of Queen Mary, University of London (QMUL) advised by Prof. Tao Xiang. My research interest includes audio/speech processing, multi-modal embodied AI, multi-agent learning and computer vision.
